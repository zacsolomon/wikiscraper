* people know how to program but don't know which problems to solve (data)
* or they know the problems or people (data) but don't know the programming

* a lot of doing data science is administrative

workshop plan
* types of files, data formats, databases, and APIs 
* developing some heuristics for getting and dealing with data


Data Sources
* files, databases, web scraping & API


* CSVs, JSON, txt (unstructured data) or even PDFs 
* avoid PDFs

* problem is that data isn't just as data, it's encoded to 
* was the data built for a human, or for computers... ? 
	If for humans, it's hard to deal with...
		like web pages.. they're meant to look good
		that makes it hard to deal with programatiically
* ideally you want to find the API, because that's meant for dealing with programmatically 



Binary files
* data stored in binary format.. not stored in plain text that you can read
	opposed to normal types that you can open and read
* useful for when you want to have data at scale 


python is not powerful alone, it's powerful as an ecosystem
	ex. scipy stack, which is built to use with python
numpy = 
	built for array = large homogeneous data

pandas = another
	built for heterogeneous data

you can save files to a binary file using numpy, and it can decode that 
it can read and write binary files

we use OOP to create objects for data science..

pickle in pandas 
allows you to save complex object objects to binary

www.data.gov

always use an API if you can
don't just scrape the website if you can because that's not meant for dealing with directly 
and try not to use RESTful APIs if you can because that's still working with the web

when i say "I will have my computer read scientific articles" it's different than "i will read scientific articles"
	NLP and text analysis
	it's not real "reading" it's looking for patterns

when using an API you use OAuth


# requesting web pages from python
import requests 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# here you're pretending to be a human


we have a list of city data with feautures we care about but it doesn't include geo info
we want to do have latitude and longtitude for these neighborhood
how do get all the
